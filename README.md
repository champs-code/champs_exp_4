#Experiment 4: Interactive Image Gallery
##Description
This project is about building a simple interactive image gallery using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
The gallery has a main display area and a set of thumbnails.
When you click on a thumbnail, the main image updates to show the larger version.
I styled the gallery using CSS with a background image (like my previous assignments), so it feels visually appealing.

##How to run this project
